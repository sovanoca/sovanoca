    // Updated FAQ data for asphalt parking lot services
    const faqs = [
        {
            question: "How long does asphalt parking lot installation take?",
            answer: "Project timelines vary based on lot size and complexity. A standard commercial parking lot installation takes 3-7 days. Small lots (10-20 spaces) may be completed in 2-4 days, while larger complexes can take 2-3 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline after our initial assessment."
        },
        {
            question: "What thickness of asphalt do you recommend for commercial lots?",
            answer: "We typically install 2-3 inches of compacted asphalt for standard vehicle traffic. For heavy truck areas, we recommend 4+ inches with specialized base materials. Our engineers assess your specific needs based on vehicle types, soil conditions, and climate factors in North Carolina."
        },
        {
            question: "Will parking lot construction disrupt my business operations?",
            answer: "We minimize disruption through phased construction and strategic scheduling. For retail businesses, we work after hours or section off work areas. We maintain safe access routes and provide clear signage throughout the project. Most clients experience minimal operational impact."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should asphalt parking lots be maintained?",
            answer: "We recommend sealcoating every 2-3 years and regular inspections for cracks and drainage issues. Proper maintenance extends asphalt life to 15-20+ years in NC's climate. Our maintenance plans include crack filling, pothole repair, and sealcoating."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide striping and marking services?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer comprehensive line striping with durable, reflective thermoplastic markings. We follow ADA compliance standards and can incorporate custom branding elements. Our markings typically last 12-18 months before needing refreshment."
        },
        {
            question: "What's included in your asphalt warranty?",
            answer: "Our 5-year warranty covers material defects and workmanship. It includes protection against premature cracking, raveling, and drainage failures under normal conditions. We provide detailed warranty documentation upon project completion."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you repair existing asphalt instead of replacing?",
            answer: "Absolutely. We assess each lot individually - many can be restored through milling, resurfacing, and targeted repairs at 30-50% of replacement cost. We'll provide honest recommendations on repair vs. replacement options."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you handle drainage in parking lots?",
            answer: "We design lots with 1-2% slope for proper runoff, incorporating catch basins, trench drains, and permeable asphalt options where needed. Our designs meet NC stormwater regulations and prevent pooling that damages asphalt."
