        {
            question: "How long does a complete interior/exterior painting project take?",
            answer: "Project timelines vary based on property size and scope. A typical single-family home takes 3-7 days for interiors and 5-10 days for exteriors. Commercial projects may take 2-6 weeks. We provide detailed timelines after assessing your specific needs."
        },
        {
            question: "What types of paint do you use for interior and exterior projects?",
            answer: "We use premium-quality paints from Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore. For interiors, we use low-VOC paints for better air quality. For exteriors, we use weather-resistant formulations specifically designed for North Carolina's climate conditions."
        },
        {
            question: "Will painting disrupt my daily routine or business operations?",
            answer: "We minimize disruption through careful planning. For residential interiors, we work room-by-room. For businesses, we can work after hours or section off areas. Our team maintains clean workspaces and respects your schedule."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should I repaint my home or business?",
            answer: "Interiors typically need repainting every 3-7 years, while exteriors need refreshing every 5-10 years depending on material and exposure. We offer free inspections to assess your property's needs."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide color consultation services?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer complimentary color consultation. Our experts help select colors that enhance your space, reflect your style, and consider lighting conditions and architectural features."
        },
        {
            question: "What surfaces can you paint?",
            answer: "We paint all interior and exterior surfaces including drywall, wood, brick, stucco, metal, concrete, and more. We properly prepare each surface type for optimal paint adhesion and longevity."
        },
        {
            question: "Are your paints eco-friendly and safe?",
            answer: "Absolutely. We use low-VOC and zero-VOC paints that meet strict environmental standards. Many products are GreenGuard certified for indoor air quality and safe for families and pets."
        },
        {
            question: "What is included in your painting warranty?",
            answer: "Our comprehensive warranty covers peeling, blistering, chipping, and excessive fading under normal conditions for 5 years on exteriors and 2 years on interiors, including both materials and labor."
