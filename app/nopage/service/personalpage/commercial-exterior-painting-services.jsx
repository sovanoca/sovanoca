    // FAQ data specific to commercial exterior painting
    const faqs = [
        {
            question: "How long does a commercial exterior painting project take?",
            answer: "Project timelines vary based on building size and condition. A typical commercial painting project takes 2-4 weeks. Small storefronts may be completed in 3-5 days, while larger buildings like shopping centers can take 3-6 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline after our initial assessment."
        },
        {
            question: "What types of paint do you use for commercial exteriors?",
            answer: "We use premium commercial-grade paints from industry leaders like Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore. These include 100% acrylic elastomeric coatings for masonry, advanced acrylics for metal surfaces, and specialized UV-resistant finishes. All products are specifically formulated for North Carolina's climate conditions."
        },
        {
            question: "Will painting disrupt my business operations?",
            answer: "We minimize disruption through careful planning. We work after hours for retail businesses, section off work areas, and use low-odor paints. For most projects, we can complete work without requiring business closure. We'll develop a customized schedule that works with your operations."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should commercial buildings be repainted?",
            answer: "Most commercial buildings in NC need repainting every 5-8 years. Factors like sun exposure, material type (brick, stucco, metal), and coastal proximity affect longevity. We offer free inspections to determine when your property needs maintenance."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide color consultation services?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer complimentary color consultation with all commercial painting projects. Our design experts will help you select colors that enhance your branding, complement your architecture, and meet any HOA or zoning requirements."
        },
        {
            question: "What surfaces can you paint?",
            answer: "We paint all commercial exterior surfaces including: brick, stucco, concrete, metal, wood, EIFS, fiber cement siding, and vinyl. We have specialized preparation and painting techniques for each material to ensure optimal adhesion and longevity."
        },
        {
            question: "Are your paints eco-friendly?",
            answer: "We use low-VOC and zero-VOC paints that meet EPA standards. Many of our products are GreenGuard certified and contribute toward LEED certification points. We also implement sustainable practices like proper waste disposal and recycling of materials."
        },
        {
            question: "What is included in your 5-year warranty?",
            answer: "Our comprehensive warranty covers: peeling, blistering, chipping, cracking, and excessive fading under normal conditions. It includes both materials and labor. We provide detailed warranty documentation upon project completion."
