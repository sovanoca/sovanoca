        {
            question: "How quickly can you provide a preacquisition estimate in North Carolina?",
            answer: "We typically deliver preliminary estimates within 48 hours of property viewing. Comprehensive reports with detailed renovation costs are completed in 5-7 business days. For urgent acquisitions in competitive NC markets, we offer 24-hour rush services."
        },
        {
            question: "What factors do you consider in your property assessments?",
            answer: "Our NC assessments include: structural integrity, foundation condition, roofing, HVAC systems, electrical/plumbing, environmental hazards, code compliance issues, renovation potential, local market trends, and zoning regulations specific to North Carolina municipalities."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you provide post-acquisition renovation estimates?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer integrated services. Our preacquisition report includes a detailed renovation scope with cost projections. After purchase, we provide updated estimates reflecting actual conditions and help develop a phased implementation plan for North Carolina properties."
        },
        {
            question: "How accurate are your cost estimates?",
            answer: "Our estimates are accurate within 5-7% of actual costs for NC properties. We maintain real-time databases of material and labor costs across North Carolina regions. We also factor in local permitting fees, HOA requirements, and NC-specific building codes."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you help identify hidden problems before purchase?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Our consultants specialize in uncovering costly issues like foundation problems, moisture damage, outdated electrical systems, and environmental hazards. We've helped NC investors avoid properties with $50k+ in hidden repair costs."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you work with out-of-state investors buying NC properties?",
            answer: "Yes, 40% of our clients are out-of-state investors. We provide virtual consultations, detailed video walkthroughs, and coordinate with local agents. Our reports include explanations of NC-specific considerations like hurricane mitigation and humidity control."
        },
        {
            question: "What areas of North Carolina do you serve?",
            answer: "We cover all major NC markets including Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, Asheville, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Wilmington, and surrounding areas. Our consultants have localized knowledge of 120+ municipalities and their specific regulations."
        },
        {
            question: "How do your services reduce investment risk?",
            answer: "Our clients avoid overpaying by an average of 12% and reduce renovation budget overruns by 22%. We identify 92% of major issues pre-purchase, giving you negotiation leverage and preventing costly surprises after acquisition."
