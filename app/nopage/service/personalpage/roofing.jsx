        {
            question: "How long does a typical roof replacement take?",
            answer: "Most residential roof replacements in North Carolina take 1-3 days depending on the size of your home, roof complexity, and weather conditions. We work efficiently to minimize disruption while ensuring quality workmanship."
        },
        {
            question: "What roofing materials are best for North Carolina's climate?",
            answer: "We recommend asphalt shingles for most homes due to their durability and cost-effectiveness. For premium options, consider metal roofing which offers superior protection against severe weather. We'll help you choose the best material for your specific location and budget."
        },
        {
            question: "How often should I have my roof inspected?",
            answer: "We recommend annual inspections, especially after severe weather events. Regular inspections can identify minor issues before they become major problems, potentially saving you thousands in repair costs."
        },
        {
            question: "What are signs that I need a new roof?",
            answer: "Key indicators include: missing or curling shingles, granule loss in gutters, daylight visible through roof boards, sagging areas, or if your roof is over 20 years old. We offer free inspections to assess your roof's condition."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer emergency roof repair services?",
            answer: "Yes, we provide 24/7 emergency roof repair services across North Carolina. Whether it's storm damage or a sudden leak, our team responds quickly to protect your home from further damage."
        },
        {
            question: "What's included in your roofing warranty?",
            answer: "We offer comprehensive warranties that cover both materials and workmanship. Most asphalt shingle roofs come with 25-50 year manufacturer warranties, and we back our installation with a 10-year workmanship warranty."
        },
        {
            question: "How does roofing impact energy efficiency?",
            answer: "A properly installed roof with adequate ventilation can significantly reduce cooling costs. We offer energy-efficient roofing options including cool roof shingles and proper insulation solutions to help lower your energy bills."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you handle insurance claims for storm damage?",
            answer: "Yes, we work directly with insurance companies and can help navigate the claims process. Our team documents all damage thoroughly and provides detailed estimates to ensure you get the coverage you're entitled to."
