        {
            question: "How long does a typical kitchen remodel take?",
            answer: "Most kitchen remodels take 4-8 weeks from start to finish, depending on the scope. Small updates may take 2-3 weeks, while full gut renovations with layout changes can take 8-12 weeks. We provide a detailed timeline after our initial consultation."
        },
        {
            question: "What's included in your kitchen remodeling services?",
            answer: "We offer complete kitchen transformations including cabinet refacing/replacement, countertop installation, backsplash tiling, flooring, lighting, plumbing fixtures, appliance installation, and custom storage solutions. We handle everything from design to final installation."
        },
        {
            question: "Will I be without a kitchen during the remodel?",
            answer: "We plan carefully to minimize disruption. For most projects, we can set up a temporary kitchen space. Major work is completed as quickly as possible, and we maintain clean work areas daily. Many clients are surprised by how manageable the process is."
        },
        {
            question: "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in North Carolina?",
            answer: "Costs vary based on size and materials, but most complete remodels range from $25,000-$60,000. Minor updates start around $10,000. We provide transparent pricing and help you prioritize elements to fit your budget while maximizing value."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you help with kitchen design and layout?",
            answer: "Absolutely! Our design team creates functional, beautiful kitchens tailored to your cooking style and family needs. We consider workflow triangles, storage solutions, lighting plans, and aesthetic preferences to design your dream kitchen."
        },
        {
            question: "What cabinet options do you offer?",
            answer: "We provide a range of options from stock to semi-custom and full custom cabinets. Materials include hardwood, plywood, and eco-friendly alternatives. Finishes range from painted to stained, in both traditional and contemporary styles."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you work with my existing kitchen layout?",
            answer: "Yes, we often update kitchens within the existing footprint to save costs. However, if structural changes would significantly improve functionality, we'll discuss those options with you and handle all necessary permits and engineering."
        },
        {
            question: "What warranty do you offer on kitchen remodels?",
            answer: "We provide a 5-year warranty on craftsmanship and installation. Materials carry manufacturer warranties (often 10+ years for cabinets, lifetime for countertops). We stand behind our work and address any post-installation issues promptly."
