            question: "What types of electrical upgrades do you offer?",
            answer: "We provide comprehensive services including panel upgrades, whole-house rewiring, GFCI/AFCI installation, lighting upgrades, EV charger installation, surge protection, and smart home automation integration. All work meets or exceeds North Carolina electrical codes."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I know if my electrical system needs upgrading?",
            answer: "Warning signs include: frequent breaker trips, flickering lights, burning smells, outdated fuse boxes, discolored outlets, lack of GFCI protection, and insufficient outlets. We offer free safety inspections to assess your system."
        },
        {
            question: "Will electrical upgrades disrupt my business operations?",
            answer: "We minimize disruption through careful planning. For commercial projects, we work after hours or weekends. For residential, we work room-by-room and maintain a clean workspace. Critical circuits can often remain live during upgrades."
        },
        {
            question: "Are your electricians licensed and insured?",
            answer: "Yes, all our electricians are licensed in North Carolina, bonded, and fully insured. We carry $2 million in liability coverage and maintain workers' compensation for all technicians."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does an electrical panel upgrade take?",
            answer: "Most residential panel upgrades take 6-10 hours. Commercial panels vary based on size and complexity, typically 1-3 days. We provide detailed timelines after assessment and obtain all necessary permits."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you handle permits and inspections?",
            answer: "Yes, we manage all aspects of permitting and coordinate with local inspectors. All work meets NEC (National Electrical Code) and North Carolina-specific requirements. We handle the paperwork so you don't have to."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you help with energy-efficient upgrades?",
            answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in LED lighting retrofits, smart thermostats, energy monitoring systems, and solar-ready electrical panels. These upgrades can reduce energy costs by 20-50% while enhancing functionality."
        },
        {
            question: "What warranty do you provide on electrical work?",
            answer: "We offer a 5-year warranty on labor and a 1-year warranty on materials. Manufacturer warranties apply to fixtures and equipment. All warranty details are provided in writing upon project completion."
